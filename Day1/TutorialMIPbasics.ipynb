    "\n",
    "In this tutorial session, we will learn how to use the FICO Xpress and SCIP Python interfaces to efficiently model and solve basic mixed-integer programming problems via a series of in-class exercises.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instructions:\n",
    "- the tutorial is hands-on, with text descriptions, mathematical formulations, and code snippets shown along the notebook to be analyzed, run and understood in the order they appear.\n",
    "- it is divided in 4 parts, which will be solved using the FICO Xpress Python interface. Parts 1S and 2S, at the end of the notebook, correspond to the first two parts but using the SCIP Python interface.\n",
    "  - you are expected to solve, in class, all the assignments marked as **EXERCISE**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Software requirements:\n",
    "- if running in cloud (recommended):\n",
    "  - https://github.com/features/codespaces (recommended)\n",
    "  - https://colab.research.google.com/\n",
    "  - (no Python installation needed, but you need to install \"xpress\", \"PySCIPOpt\" packages, and other packages in the remote machine by running \"!pip install [module]\" - see first code cell)\n",
    "- if run locally (if you are an expert user):\n",
    "  - your favorite IDE that supports Interactive Python Notebooks, such as VS Code, PyCharm, or Jupyter notebook\n",
    "  - Python installation >= 3.9\n",
    "  - Xpress package >= 9.4\n",
    "  - PySCIPOpt package >= 5.1\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples and documentation:\n",
    "* Check the [Xpress Python API reference manual](https://www.fico.com/fico-xpress-optimization/docs/latest/solver/optimizer/python/HTML) and the [Xpress Python examples](https://www.fico.com/fico-xpress-optimization/docs/latest/solver/optimizer/python/HTML/chExamples.html) online, and find a PDF with training slides named \"xpress_python_api.pdf\" in the shared GitHub repo.\n",

    "Licensing guidelines:\n",
    "- FICO Xpress Optimizer requires a full license for some of the exercises. You will receive a license file via e-mail, which you should upload into the root directory of your codespace.\n",
    "  - an environment variable named XPAUTH_PATH must be set to (the path to) the license file \"xpauth.xpr\" (automatically done in Codespaces, see code cell below for Google Colab).\n",
