# CO@Work 2024 Workshop
[CO@Work](https://co-at-work.zib.de/) is a summer school aimed at students and practitioners of mathematical optimization. The 2024 edition is located at [Zuse Institute Berlin](https://www.zib.de/), with the option of attending remotely. 

From days 17 to 19 of September, three tutorial sessions are scheduled. They were prepared by Bruno Vieira, Mohammed Ghannam, and João Dionísio. The three days are organized as follows:

- Day 1: Basics of MIP modeling. 
- Day 2: Advanced MIP modeling. Callback functions
- Day 3: Implementing Branch-and-Price. Column generation, branching.

The first two days will focus primarily on FICO Xpress, while the third day is dedicated to SCIP. Both solvers will be accessed from their respective Python interfaces.

The material for each day can be found in the respective folder, with further instructions inside on how to proceed.


## Getting Started
For the easiest and smoothest experience, **use GitHub codespaces** to start a development environment in the cloud. On the main page of the [co-at-work-2024 github repository](https://github.com/mmghannam/co-at-work-2024):
  - click on the green `code` button on the top-right
  - select the tab `codespaces` and add a new one by clicking the `+` button
  - after the codespace is created, open the notebook for the corresponding day, e.g. `Day1/TutorialMIPbasics.ipynb`
  - after the notebook is opened, on the top-right corner, click on the `Select Kernel` button and select `Install/enable suggested extensions` (Python/Jupyter)
  - after installation, select `Python Environments`, and then select the Python version installed

After that, you're ready to go and can run the first code cell!
